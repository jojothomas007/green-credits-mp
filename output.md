The introduction of an automated claims processing process can significantly
improve the efficiency and accuracy of your insurance operations. A detailed
description of the structure of such a process is provided below:

  1. **Disclaimer Submission**  
Digital Submission: Policyholders can submit claims via a mobile app or online
portal. This first step can be automated with AI-based virtual assistants or
chatbots that guide users throughout the process, ensuring that all necessary
information is accurately collected.

  2. **Initial review and validation**  
Verification of contract coverage: The system automatically checks whether the
claim is covered by the contract. This involves verifying the details of the
contract and ensuring that the claim type is covered.

Checking the claim amount: The system compares the amount claimed with the
contract limits and historical data to ensure that it is within acceptable
ranges.

  3. **Document verification**  
Automated data retrieval: AI tools extract data from supporting documents such
as receipts, medical records and repair specifications. Natural Language
Automatic Processing Algorithms (NLTs) can interpret unstructured data,
ensuring complete data extraction.

Document Validation: The system verifies the authenticity and relevance of the
submitted documents. This may include checking falsified or falsified
documents using advanced image recognition and forensic analysis techniques.

  4. **Detection of fraud**  
Behavioral profile: AI-based fraud detection systems analyse large data sets
to identify trends and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. These
systems use predictive modelling to report suspicious requests and examine
them in more detail.

Real-time follow-up: Ongoing monitoring of claim data identifies and reports
potentially fraudulent claims as soon as they are submitted.

  5. **Decision making**  
Automated arbitration: The system applies predefined rules to determine the
validity of the application. This includes verifying insurance policy rules,
coverage limits and any other criteria defined by the insurer.

**Human Intervention (HITL)** : For complex or reported claims, a claims
expert reviews the automated decision. This ensures that all specific nuances
or cases are handled properly.

  6. **Payment processing**  
Automated payments: Once the application is approved, the system initiates the
payment process. Digital payment methods ensure fast and accurate
transactions, thereby reducing claims resolution times.

  7. **Post-processing and analysis**  
Disclaimer Analysis: After processing, the system analyses disaster data to
identify trends, customer behaviour and improvement directions. This improves
the process of processing claims and improves overall efficiency.

**Re feedback loop** : Continuous learning capabilities enable the system to
adapt to new trends and improve its accuracy over time.

Advantages of automated claims processing  
**Effectiveness** : Reduces claims processing times, thus accelerating
settlements and improving client satisfaction.

**Precision** : Minimizes errors by automating repetitive tasks and ensuring
data accuracy.

**Prevention of fraud** : Improves fraud detection capabilities, thereby
reducing financial losses associated with fraudulent claims.

**Economies** : Reduces operational costs by reducing manual tasks and
simplifying workflows.

By implementing an automated claims processing stream, your insurance company
can improve efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction, while reducing
fraud risks and operating costs.
